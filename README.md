# Venemy
An intelligence tool for Venmo. Presented at conINT2020, Bsides Charleston 2019, Avengercon 2019, and Layer8 2019. Use wisely/be an infosec hero - not responsible for any misuse.

# Update 10/12/2020
It's been awhile since I've updated this and things have changed over at Venmo. This is *great*, actually from privacy and security perspectives. They've taken steps (albeit minor) to improve the security of their API and provided more transparency on user settings for making things private. Most of the API endpoints now require authentication. However, anyone with an account can get an API token and gain access to their API endpoints where they can gather all the things. I've updated this repo to account for the new oAuth process and accessing the updated API endpoints. Changes:
  - You can gain your API credentials directly from the script with the -a (or --auth) flag
  - Updated collected fields based on the API endpoints
  - Authenticated and Unauthenticated code merged into one
  - Full credit for the automation of obtaining an API token goes to [mmohades](https://github.com/mmohades/Venmo)

# Venemy - Authenticated
The authenticated module allows for much more data to be collected. This module requires an API token (available to all accounts, no additional signups). In order to set this up, perform the following:
  - Copy the venmo.ini.example file to venmo.ini: `cp venmo.ini.example venmo.ini`.
  - Provide you username and password in the venmo.ini file
  - Use the `--auth` flag to invoke this process. You'll be prompted for a OTP and should receive a text message to your phone. Enter the code and press enter. You'll be issued an API key.
  - Take the API key and put it in your venmo.ini file. You're now ready to start using the authenticated options for venemy.

## Usage:
#### Grab basic information from a user from the /user endpoint
    python venemy.py --user username

#### Grab the list of friends from the /user/[id]/friends API endpoint
    python venemy.py --friends username

#### Grab the list of transactions from the /user/[id]/feed API endpoint
    python venemy.py --trans username

#### Grab all the things - info, friends, transactions.
    python venemy.py --all username

#### Friend of a friend - provide a username. For each friend in that friend list (from the friend endpoint), it will grab their friend's list e.g. 2nd degree of separation)
    python venemy.py --crawl username
    
#### Add the --pic flag to the options above to download profile pictures
    python venemy_auth.py --friends username --pic

# Venemy - Unauthenticated
If wanting to avoid creating an account, there's an option to use some HTML scraping. This can also help you do some initial recon without having to login.

## Usage:
#### Check a single username
    python venemy.py --noauth UserName

#### Brute-force for a profile - will try several variations of the person's name or suggested username (e.g. if they use they same username for multiple account/sites)
    python venemy.py --brute-force Person's name
